Compatability
It should be cross-browser compatible, currently IE6 and IE7 need some work.  There are some CSS3 properties but they should degrade correctly.  If you notice any issues please post to the queue as we're trying to optimize this for all audiences.

Note: The Instant preview isn't perfect but it's a great example of what will be displayed when you Submit the settings.  Because of some hover state complexity it's about 95% correct.

Specifications
The "Logo" image that's used for the banner is 950 x 108.  It can display larger ones correctly since it's just a window but since it's a background render won't work with anything smaller (without whitespace that is).

To change the top logo for Logo 1 and Logo 2 settings, create a file called top_logo_01.png or top_logo_02.png and put them in the images folder.

To change the bottom logo for Logo 1 and Logo 2 settings, create a file called bottom_logo_01.png or bottom_logo_02.png and put them in the images folder.
