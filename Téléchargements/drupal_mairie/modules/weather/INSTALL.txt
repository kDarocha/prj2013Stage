Installation
------------

* Create a new directory "weather" in your modules directory.
* Copy the module into the newly created module/weather directory.
* Go to admin/build/modules and enable the weather module.
* Go on with the configuration, see below.

Configuration
-------------

* If you want to have a system-wide weather block (i.e. the same
  location for every user), go to Administer->Site configuration->Weather
  and configure the location. Go to Administer->Site building->Blocks
  and enable the "Weather: system-wide" block.
* If you want to allow users to configure their own custom weather
  blocks, go to Administer->Site building->Blocks and enable the
  "Weather: custom user" block. You might want to change the
  "Custom visibility settings" in the configuration page of the block to
  "Hide this block by default but let individual users show it."
  Afterwards, go to Administer->User management->Access control and
  set the "administer custom weather block" permission for the
  appropriate role.
* Go to Administer->Site configuration->Weather or "My weather" and
  select the location for which you would like to display the current
  weather conditions.
* If you want to add another location to your block, click on the link
  "Add another location to the block", right under the button
  "Save configuration". If you have configured multiple locations, they
  will be listed on the bottom of the page. Click on the location to
  change the configuration, or click on "Delete configuration" to
  remove it from your block.
* Optionally, decide which units should be used for displaying the
  weather data.
* You can also set the weight of the location, to change the order
  of appearance in the block.
